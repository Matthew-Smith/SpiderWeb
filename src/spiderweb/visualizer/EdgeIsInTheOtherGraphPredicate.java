/**
 * This class is a predicate, and as such the logical predicate implemented is the following :
 * the predicate is related to a particular graph, and evaluates if the given vertex exists within the associated graph.
 * This is used because the simulation contains two graphs, one partly visible, that maintains the full layout,
 * and one invisible, which simply stores the information of the graph state as the simulation proceeds.
